    <h2>Ronaldo Campos Lucas</h2>

    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Ronaldo Campos. I'm from Costa Rica. I'm 24 years old. I am single and currently work at Amazon.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church all my life. I had the privilege of serving as a missionary in the Chile Concepci√≥n Mission. The Gospel has been a blessing to me, it has helped me progress temporally and spiritually.</p>
    <p>I am very excited to start this path, one of my goals is to become a Full-Stack developer, get the Applied Technology degree and I know that with this course, with effort and with the help of the Lord I can achieve this goal.</p>
