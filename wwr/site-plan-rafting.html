    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of our website is to provide information about our business and create a marketplace where our services can be purchased. This will benefit our company by providing a revenue stream for those who may not be able or interested to visit our plave of business before making a purchasing decision or completing a transaction. Instead this can all be performed remotely thereby greatly increasing our customer base and profitability.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>We wish to focus our efforts at targeting veterans, as well as all others interested. We will target these demographics by optimizing for keywords associated with searches for high adventure by military members both male and female ages 18-60, as well as men and women ages 25-50. The ideal candidate will be able to schedule and purchase services well in advance, and will be encouraged to do so accompanied by a group through price structure incentives attached to party size. Incentives will also be provided to individuals who maintain active military and/or veteran status. Most users will access the desktop version of site through links from searches and adds. We hope to meet the needs of individuals who wish to experience the beautiful nature, waterways, and wildlife of the forest but are unfamiliar with its terrain and how to navigate it.    </p>
