        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>About me.</strong> The people who will come to my site will want to know about me, it may be to take me into account in a project, in a job, in a role, so they will expect to know me, my knowledge and my skills. So the purpose of this page is that they can know me as a person, my goals, a summary of my life, my hobbies, in such a way that when they see my projects, the courses and the other topics of the site, they can have my image in their mind and they can see on my side, a real person, not just a candidate.

      </ul>
      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Projects. </strong>Visitors will want to see if I have the necessary skills to help them with what they need. That is the purpose of this page, to show projects in which I have worked, to explain which technologies I used, what results I achieved and how this project demonstrates my knowledge. It is through the projects that visitors will see my experience, so this page is of the utmost importance. Through this page visitors will have access to each of my projects, it can be a link to a website or a link that takes them to a github page where I have the executable files. Each project will have its description, it will explain what the purpose of the project is and it will say what technologies were used to carry out the project and how that project is evidence that I have knowledge of those technologies.

      </ul>
      <h3>Courses</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Courses. </strong>After having shown my projects, I want visitors to know how I acquired this knowledge, where I learned, what courses I took, I want them to know what other technologies I have learned that could be of help to them as well. I want to explain how much I know about these technologies. I will put a link to each of these technologies that allows you to download a PDF with a certificate as evidence of a completed course. Visitors look for specific characteristics but on this page they can find other characteristics in me, which they may not have been looking for but which may still be of help to them. That is why I consider this page to be very important.
